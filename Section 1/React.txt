React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
React allows us to build seamless and smooth interfaces building up code from JavaScript
to create a better system which renders changes in such a way that it is smoother without
having the feel of a heavy code which is slow to run.
Using just JavaScript is riddled with inefficient code which slows down over big applciations,
React allows you to reuse code and functions and components which makes the code run better.
